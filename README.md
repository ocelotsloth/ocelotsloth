### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### Advent of Code 2022

If you'd like to check in on the elves, I'm working on them in this Jupyter Notebook:

  - https://github.com/ocelotsloth/adventofcode/blob/mainline/2022/Advent%20of%20Code%202022.ipynb

I'm intentionally not doing these until a while after they release so I don't trash my sleep. So no leaderboards for me.
